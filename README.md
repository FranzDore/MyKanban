# ATTENTION
The starting point of the WebApp is the "index.html" file contained into "WebDevFinalProject" directory.
When loaded, all the other pages are accessible from there (component style organization)

This application is meant as a project for an exam, errors and bugs are to be found, and app is to be perfected. It is not meant to be divulged.

### No framework has been used for the creation of the application, instead, hand-written vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript was used.
